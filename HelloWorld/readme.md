Hello git, this is my first github experience and I am excited ☺️.
This is also for me to learn

git status = checks your commits

git add <file name here> = tracks your files

git commit -m 'enter message here' = is like taking a screenshot of your file at a certain time
and telling git to remember it

git add ./ = tells git to add all the files modified, created, or deleted to the git tracking
